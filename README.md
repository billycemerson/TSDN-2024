## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of the **TSD 2024 Competition**, where we developed a **Streamlit-based web application** for predicting multiple **non-communicable diseases** and providing recommendations using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

The diseases covered include:
- **Hypertension**
- **Diabetes**
- **Lung Cancer**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project consists of:

1. **Presentation (Final Stage Submission)**
   - **Prediction Model:**
     - **Random Forest** for disease diagnosis based on patient data.
   - **Recommendation System:**
     - **RAG-based** suggestions for lifestyle modifications and medical guidance.
   - **Web App Development:**
     - Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## ðŸš€ Technologies & Frameworks
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, joblib, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest for disease prediction)
- **Generative AI** (Gemini AI for RAG-based recommendations)
- **LangChain** (Integration for advanced retrieval and reasoning)
- **Streamlit** (Web app development for user-friendly interaction)
